Webinterface for Managing Minecraft and bungee servers.

This project has been started in Janunary 2017 because there is no Web Management Tool available that matches my needs.

Planned features (as of 2017/01)

* Monitor several minecraft/spigot/bungee servers
* Show "Ping" Information from each server
* Show "Query" Information (if server supports it)
* Possibility to send RCON Commands (if server supports it)

Demo site coming soon, contributors welcome!
